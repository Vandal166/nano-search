# nano-search

**nano-search** is a fast, file indexing and search tool for Windows made with WPF.  
It indexes files on any specified drive from the configuration options and allows pattern-based file lookup using glob syntax or just simply search plain file names. Internally, it uses a **Radix Tree** for efficient storage and retrieval.

## Features

- Index files(configurable) - by default searches only for `.exe`
- Search files using the Search Window by:
  - Exact filename (e.g., `myfile.exe`)
  - Glob patterns (e.g., `*.exe`, `myfile*.exe`)
- Showing the Search Window via an set hotkey
- Opening the file's directory in the File Explorer
- Launching the app either via left click or Enter key
- Navigating the search results via arrow keys
- Choosing which drives to index
- Fully configurable indexing options:
  - For Files skipping:
    1. any file leading with an character
    2. any file that has the attribute
    <span id="inc3">3. *including* (not skipping) an file that has the specified extension</span>
    4. any file that does not meet the regex name pattern specified in the configuration file
    - The order of the applied filters are as above, an file is indexed once every filter hasn't skipped the file
  - For Directories skipping:
    1. basically the same as for files except it  skips commonly named directories(such as `System`) instead of point c) in [c)](#inc3)
- Configurable hotkeys for showing the Search Window
- Configurable hotkeys for navigating the search results
- Reindexing the files again
- Toggling the appearance of the Tray Icon in the tray bar
- Any of the settings may be restored to their default state
- Any error while executing those features will display an user-friendly notification

Why not use the NTFS Master File Table (MFT) to scan?
- it requires admin privileges
- works only for NTFS
- hard p/invoke implementatino ;C
- would need to fallback to standard win32 if NTFS is not available
